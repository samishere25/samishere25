### 🌼 Hey, I'm Samiksha!  

💻 I love creating things — from small coding projects to ideas that can actually make someone’s life easier.  
🎯 I enjoy learning at my own pace and turning every new skill into something practical and fun.  
💬 I believe consistency > perfection — every day is just about getting a little better.  
🌱 Currently focusing on improving my skills in **Python, web development, and data science**.  
🎨 Outside tech, you’ll find me obsessed with **fashion, food, and aesthetics** (yes, all at once 😌).  
💫 Always open to learning, collaborating, and trying something new.
